## Hi there 👋

🎓 I'm currently learning to code and building cool projects as I go!  
🚀 My goal is to become a full-stack web developer and master real-world coding skills.  
📚 I'm using GitHub to share everything I'm learning — from basic JavaScript to full web apps.


## 🛠️ Tech I’m Learning

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- Node.js and React (soon!)
